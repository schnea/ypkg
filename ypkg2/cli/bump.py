## The YAML 1.2 spec technically does not allow key names to be greater than 128 characters. This is problematic for us
## as we use the source URI as the key in ypkg, causing the infamous splitting of long source names and causing lines
## to start with `- ?`. Override this limit in ruamel to allow us to continue to mangle the YAML spec in this way.
## 32x the limit oughta be enough for anyone, right?
