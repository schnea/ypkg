ypkg(1) \[en] Build Solus ypkg files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[CR]ypkg [OPTIONS] command [ARGS]...\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[CR]ypkg\f[R] is a tool to generate an \f[CR]eopkg\f[R] package file
from a \f[CR]package.yml(5)\f[R] file.
.PP
Note that you should not use \f[CR]ypkg(1)\f[R] directly unless
completely unavoidable.
Instead, you should be using \f[CR]solbuild(1)\f[R] for isolated build
environments.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are applicable to \f[CR]ypkg(1)\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-h\f[R], \f[CR]\-\-help\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Print the command line options for \f[CR]ypkg(1)\f[R] and exit.

.SH SUBCOMMANDS
All available subcommands are listed below by their primary name.
.PP
\f[CR]build <package.yml>\f[R]
.IP
.EX
Given a \[ga]package.yml(5)\[ga] file, it will attempt to build the
package according to the rules, patterns and steps set in the
file.

For details on the package format itself, please refer to the
\[ga]package.yml(5)\[ga] manpage, or the Solus wiki.

* \[ga]\-D\[ga], \[ga]\-\-output\-dir\[ga]:

    Set the output directory for resulting files.

* \[ga]\-B\[ga], \[ga]\-\-build\-dir\[ga]:

    Set the base directory for performing the build.

* \[ga]\-t\[ga], \[ga]\-\-timestamp\[ga]:

    This argument should be a UNIX timestamp, and will be used to set the file
    timestamps inside the final \[ga].eopkg\[ga] archive, as well as the container files
    within that archive.

    Using this option helps achieve reproducible builds, and this option is passed
    by \[ga]solbuild(1)\[ga] automatically for ypkg builds. It will examine the git history
    and use the UTC UNIX timestamp for the last tag, ensuring the package can be
    built by any machine using \[ga]solbuild(1)\[ga] and result in an identical package,
    byte for byte.

* \[ga]\-n\[ga], \[ga]\-\-no\-colors\[ga]:

    Disable text colorization in the output from \[ga]ypkg(1)\[ga] and all child processes.

* \[ga]\-\-help\[ga]:

    Show help text about this command.
.EE
.PP
\f[CR]gen\-history <filename>\f[R]
.IP
.EX
Generates a history.xml file.

* \[ga]\-D\[ga], \[ga]\-\-output\-dir\[ga]:

    Set the output directory for resulting files.

* \[ga]\-\-help\[ga]:

    Show help text about this command.
.EE
.PP
\f[CR]install\-deps <package.yml>\f[R]
.IP
.EX
This command will install all of the build dependencies listed in the
given \[ga]package.yml(5)\[ga] file. Note that resolution of \[ga]pkgconfig\[ga] and \[ga]pkgconfig32\[ga]
dependencies is handled automatically.

* \[ga]\-D\[ga], \[ga]\-\-output\-dir\[ga]:

    Set the output directory for resulting files.

* \[ga]\-e\[ga], \[ga]\-\-eopkg\-cmd\[ga]:

    Specify which \[ga]eopkg(1)\[ga] command to use.

* \[ga]\-f\[ga], \[ga]\-\-force\[ga]:

    Force the installation of package dependencies, which will bypass any
    prompting by \[ga]ypkg(1)\[ga]. The default behaviour is to prompt before installing
    packages.

* \[ga]\-n\[ga], \[ga]\-\-no\-colors\[ga]:

    Disable text colorization in the output from \[ga]ypkg(1)\[ga] and all child processes.

* \[ga]\-\-help\[ga]:

    Show help text about this command.
